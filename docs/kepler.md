# Data Columns in Kepler Objects of Interest Table

The following table lists all of the data columns in the Kepler Objects of Interest table (`cumulative`) that can be returned through the Exoplanet Archive's [Application Programming Interface (API)](/docs/program_interfaces.html).

These column definitions apply to all deliveries of the KOI table. There are similar documents for [other data sets](/docs/program_interfaces.html#defcols).

For the Q1-6 delivery (Batalha et al., 2013) some values entered as 99 or -99 in the tables to indicate issues with processing have been entered as NULLS in the Kepler planet candidate table to allow better sorting and filtering. The Q1-6 table also includes the corresponding false positive list from MAST.

The number of significant digits displayed for each parameter is the same for all KOI deliveries. Given the different input data and analysis methods used for different deliveries, users are advised to use the uncertainties to understand the significance of a given parameter value.

## Identification Columns

| Database Column Name | Table Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| kepid† | Kepler Identification or KepID | Target identification number, as listed in theKepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC was derived from aground-based imaging survey of the Kepler field conducted prior to launch. The survey's purpose was to identify stars for the Kepler exoplanet surveyby magnitude and color. The full catalog of 13 million sources can be searched at theMAST archive. The subset of 4 million targets found upon the KeplerCCDs can be searched via the Kepler Target Search form. The KeplerID is unique to a target and there is only one Kepler ID per target.|
| kepoi_name† | KOI Name | A number used to identify and track a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI). A KOI is a target identified by the Kepler Project that displays at least onetransit-like sequence within Kepler time-series photometry that appears to be of astrophysical origin and initially consistent with a planetarytransit hypothesis. A KOI name has an integer and a decimal part of the format KNNNNN.DD. The integer part designates the target star; the two-digitdecimal part identifies a unique transiting object associated with that star. It is not necessarily the planetary candidate listed in that orderwithin a DV report, nor does it indicate the distance of the planet from the the host star relative to other planets in the system.|

## Exoplanet Archive Information

| Database Column Name | Table Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| kepler_name† | Kepler Name | Kepler number name in the form "Kepler-N," plus a lower-case letter, identifying the planet. In general, these numbers are easier to remember than the corresponding KOI or KIC/KepID designations and are intended to clearly indicate a class of objects that have been confirmed or validated as planets—a step up from the planet candidate designation. |
| koi_disposition† | Exoplanet Archive Disposition  | The category of this KOI from the Exoplanet Archive. Current values are CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED. All KOIs marked as CONFIRMED are also listed in the Exoplanet Archive Confirmed Planet table. Designations of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, and NOT DISPOSITIONED are taken from the Disposition Using Kepler Data. |
| koi_vet_stat | Vetting Status | The vetting status for this KOI delivery.  Current possible states are ACTIVE and DONE.  As vetting tests for the null hypothesis that a TCE is a planet are performed, the disposition of each KOI as either a planet candidate or false positive will be updated and, most importantly, may change over time. It is therefore critical that the scientific community not conduct sample completeness studies on KOI tables that remain ACTIVE. Active tables do, however, provide the latest information for community scientists interested in follow-up observations and disposition activities. After a period of  activity, the classification of the KOI table will change  from ACTIVE to DONE when all dispositions are judged as  final and all model parameters have been updated appropriately.  This will typically occur after a new delivery of TCEs to  the archive based on a longer data baseline. |
| koi_vet_date | Date of Last Parameter Update | Date of the last parameter update for this KOI. |

## Project Disposition Columns

| Database Column Name | Table Label |  Description |  Uncertainties Column (positive +) (negative -) | Displayed String Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| koi_pdisposition† | Disposition Using Kepler Data | The pipeline flag that designates the most probable physical explanation of the KOI. Typical values are FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE. The value of this flag may change over time as the evaluation of KOIs proceeds to deeper levels of analysis using Kepler time-series pixel and light curve data, or follow-up observations. A not dispositioned value corresponds to objects for which the disposition tests have not yet been completed. A false positive has failed at least one of the tests described in Batalha et al. (2012). A planetary candidate has passed all prior tests conducted to identify false positives, although this does not a priori mean that all possible tests have been conducted. A future test may confirm this KOI as a false positive. <br>False positives can occur when:     1) the KOI is in reality an eclipsing binary star,     2) the Kepler light curve is contaminated by a background eclipsing binary,     3) stellar variability is confused for coherent planetary transits, or     4) instrumental artifacts are confused for coherent planetary transits.  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_score† | Disposition Score |   A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence in the KOI disposition. For CANDIDATEs, a higher value indicates more confidence in its disposition, while for FALSE POSITIVEs, a higher value indicates less confidence in that disposition. The value is calculated from a Monte Carlo technique such that the score's value is equivalent to the frction of iterations where the Robovetter yields a disposition of CANDIDATE. | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_fpflag_nt† | Not Transit-Like Flag | A KOI whose light curve is not consistent with that of a transiting planet. This includes, but is not limited to, instrumental artifacts, non-eclipsing variable stars, and spurious (very low SNR) detections.  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_fpflag_ss† | Stellar Eclipse Flag | A KOI that is observed to have a significant secondary event, transit shape, or out-of-eclipse variability, which indicates that the transit-like event is most likely caused by an eclipsing binary. However, self-luminous, hot Jupiters with a visible secondary eclipse will also have this flag set, but with a disposition of PC. | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_fpflag_co† | Centroid Offset Flag | The source of the signal is from a nearby star, as inferred by measuring the centroid location of the image both in and out of transit, or by the strength of the transit signal in the target's outer (halo) pixels as compared to the transit signal from the pixels in the optimal (or core) aperture. | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_fpflag_ec† | Ephemeris Match Indicates Contamination Flag | The KOI shares the same period and epoch as another object and is judged to be the result of flux contamination in the aperture or electronic crosstalk. | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_disp_prov | Disposition Provenance | Disposition Provenance | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_comment | KOI Comment | A description of the reason why an object's disposition has been given as false positive. The following keywords are shorthand for certain criterion used to determine if a KOI is a false positive: <br>APO: "Active Pixel Offset" The pixels showing the transit do not coincide with the target star, indicating that the transit is actually on a background object.<br><br>Binary: Indicates the transit event is due to an eclipsing binary, not a planet.<br><br>EB: Target is an eclipsing binary, or there is an unresolved background binary.<br><br>odd-even: The depth of the even-numbered transits are statistically different than the depths of the odd-numbered transits; this is a sign of a background eclipsing binary.<br><br>V-shaped: Likely a grazing eclipsing binary.<br><br>SB1: Target star is a single-lined spectroscopic binary.<br><br>SB2: Target star is a double-lined spectroscopic binary. A comment field may also contain a list of the minor flags as set by the Robovetter. See the documents for the DR 25 and DR 24 Robovetter KOI Flags for detailed descriptions. | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

## Transit Properties

The Kepler Project typically provides transit parameters derived from a **Mandel-Agol (2002)** fit to multi-quarter Kepler light curves, assuming a linear orbital ephemeris. Some of these are direct fits, while others are derived from the best-fit parameters. Limb-darkening coefficients are pre-calculated and fixed based on host star properties. The free parameters in the fit are: Orbital Period, Transit Epoch, Planet-Star Radius Ratio, Planet-Star Distance over Star Radius, and Impact Parameter. Errors on the fit parameters are adopted from matrix covariances, which likely underestimate the true errors because they don't account for correlations between the parameters. For more details on the fits for each delivery, see the links in the Purpose of KOI document for each activity table.

**Scaled planetary parameters** are created by combining these dimensionless fit parameters with physical stellar parameters to produce planet characteristics in physical units. The best-fit planetary transit parameters are typically normalized to the size of the host star. Physical planet parameters can be derived by scaling them to the star's size and temperature. The transit parameters also have a weak dependency on the limb-darkening coefficients, which are derived from the stellar parameters (e.g., **Claret and Bloemen 2011**).

| koi_duration† |  Transit Duration (hours)  | The duration of the observed transits. Duration is measured from first contact between the planet and star until last contact. Contact times are typically computed from a best-fit model produced by a Mandel-Agol (2002) model fit to a multi-quarter Kepler light curve, assuming a linear orbital ephemeris.  |  koi_duration_err1, koi_duration_err2 | koi_duration_str |
| koi_ingress† | Ingress Duration (hours)  | The time between first and second contact of the planetary transit.

| koi_depth† | Transit Depth (parts per million) | The fraction of stellar flux lost at the minimum of the planetary transit.

This quantity is directly fitted in the LS and MCMC  methods, and is completely independent from the  listed stellar mass and radius, which are derived  using ground-based photometry, spectroscopy, and  other observations.  | koi_srho_err1, koi_srho_err2 | koi_srho_str |
| koi_fittype | Planetary Fit Type | Type of Fit for planetary parameters. Options are:<br><br>LS (Least Squares fit)<br>MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit)<br>DV (Data Validation pipeline fit) none (fit is not provided, only orbital period, transit epoch and transit duration are reported)<br>LS+MCMC (Least Squares Fit with Markov Monte Carlo error bars) | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_prad† | Planetary Radius (Earth radii) | The radius of the planet. Planetary radius is the product of the planet star radius ratio and the stellar radius.  | koi_prad_err1, koi_prad_err2 | koi_prad_str |
| koi_sma | Orbit Semi-Major Axis (Astronomical Unit (au)) | Half of the long axis of the ellipse defining a planet's orbit. For a circular orbit this is the planet-star separation radius. The semi-major axis is derived based on Kepler's third law, i.e., utilizing the orbital period and stellar mass, not<br>scaling the planet-star separation by the stellar radius.  | koi_sma_err1, koi_sma_err2 | koi_sma_str |
| koi_incl | Inclination (deg) | The angle between the plane of the sky (perpendicular to the line of sight) and the orbital plane of the planet candidate. |  koi_incl_err1, koi_incl_err2 | koi_incl_str |
| koi_teq† | Equilibrium Temperature (Kelvin) | Approximation for the temperature of the planet. The calculation of equilibrium temperature assumes a) thermodynamic equilibrium between the incident stellar flux and the radiated heat from the planet, b) a Bond albedo (the fraction of total power incident upon the planet scattered back into space) of 0.3, c) the planet and star are blackbodies, and d) the heat is evenly distributed between the day and night sides of the planet.  | koi_teq_err1, koi_teq_err2 | koi_teq_str |
| koi_insol† | Insolation Flux [Earth flux] | Insolation flux is another way to give the equilibrium temperature. It depends on the stellar parameters (specifically the stellar radius and temperature), and on the semi-major axis of the planet. It's given<br>in units relative to those measured for the Earth from the Sun. | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| koi_dor | Planet-Star Distance over Star Radius |  The distance between the planet and the star at       mid-transit divided by the stellar radius.

| koi_ldm_coeff1,  koi_ldm_coeff2,  koi_ldm_coeff3,  koi_ldm_coeff4  | Limb Darkening Coefficients  |     Up to four coefficients (a1, a2, a3, a4) that define stellar limb darkening       (e.g., Claret 2000). Limb darkening is      the variation of specific intensity of the star as a function of μ = cos(θ). θ is the angle between the       line-of-sight of an observer and a line perpendicular to the stellar surface at an observed point. Coefficients       are dependent upon stellar temperature, surface gravity       and metallicity. Adopted coefficients are required input       for Mandel-Agol (2002) fits and are       extracted from archived tables (e.g.,       Claret and Bloemen 2011). Limb-darkening coefficients remain fixed during fit       minimization. Note that the dependence of limb-darkening       coefficients on stellar parameters implies that planet       radius does not scale linearly with stellar radius.       If new stellar parameters are adopted, the most-correct       approach is to re-fit the transit with new limb-darkening       coefficients in order to re-measure planet size.  | &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |

## Threshold-Crossing Event (TCE) Information

The **Transiting Planet Search (TPS) module** of the Kepler data analysis pipeline tests for planet transits within the multi-quarter, gap-filled flux time series. The module first detrends each quarterly **PDC light curve** to remove edge effects around data gaps, then combines and interpolates the data to prepare the time series for a matched filter. An adaptive, wavelet-based matched filter (**Jenkins 2002**, **Jenkins et al. 2010**, and **Tenenbaum et al. 2012**) is then used for a joint characterization of observation noise and to detect transit-like features in the light curve.

The TPS module estimates the Power Spectral Density of the flux time series over time. This provides coefficients for a whitening filter, accommodating non-stationary, non-white noise and producing **Single Event Statistic (SES)** time series components. These can be seen as measurements of the statistical significance of a transit of a trial duration at each point in the time series.

Single Event Statistics are folded at each trial orbital period, and the maximum **Multiple Event Statistic (MES)** is obtained over all trial periods and phases. The MES estimates the signal-to-noise ratio of the potential transit-like sequence against the measurement noise. The MES threshold for defining the sample of **Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs)** is provided in the Release Notes. For example, a lower MES threshold of 7.1σ limits the number of false positives in the TCE sample from statistical random noise to less than 1 over the primary mission (**Jenkins, Caldwell and Borucki 2002**).

| Database Column Name | Table Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| koi_max_sngle_ev   | Maximum Single Event Statistic | The maximum calculated value of the SES. Maximum SES statistics for different TCEs from the same target differ because the most significant TCE is removed from the time series before repeating the test for further, weaker transit signals.  |
| koi_max_mult_ev | Maximum Multiple Event Statistic | The maximum calculated value of the MES. TCEs that meet the maximum MES threshold criterion and other criteria listed in the TCE release notes are delivered to the Data Validation (DV) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline for transit characterization and the calculation of statistics required for disposition. A TCE exceeding the maximum MES threshold are removed from the time-series data and the SES and MES statistics recalculated. If a second TCE exceeds the maximum MES threshold then it is also propagated through the DV module and the cycle is iterated until no more events exceed the criteria. Candidate multi-planet systems are thus found this way. Users of the TCE table can exploit the maximum MES statistic to help filter and sort samples of TCEs for the purposes of discerning the event quality, determining the likelihood of planet candidacy, or assessing the risks of observational follow-up. |

| koi_quarters | Quarters  | A bit string indicating which quarters of Kepler data were searched for transit signatures. Reading from left to right, the bits indicate the quarters, starting with quarter 1. A value of 1 for any bit means the designated quarter was searched for transits; a value of 0 means that quarter was not included in the transit search. |

| koi_model_dof | Model Degrees of Freedom (DOF) |  The number of degrees of freedom used when fitting the transit model to the data. |

## Pixel-Based KOI Vetting Statistics

Planetary transit false positives are commonly caused by light curve contamination from an eclipsing binary falling partially within the target aperture (i.e., the pixels used to collect and sum target flux). Two pixel analysis methods are used to identify such eclipsing binaries for unsaturated target stars: flux-weighted centroiding, which measures how the center of light in the collected pixels changes during a transit, and PRF-fit difference images, which localize the source of the transit signal. Both methods provide an estimate of the location of the source of the transit signal. When that source location is offset from the target star by more than 3-σ, it is likely the transit signal is due to a background source (note the caveats due to crowding described below). These analysis techniques use pixel-level data, available in the Target Pixel Files (TPFs). The resulting position measurements are compared with the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) (Brown et al. 2011). Details on these centroid methods are found in Bryson et. al. 2013.

When the target star is saturated (Kepler magnitude larger than about 11.5) the centroid results given in this section are invalid. In this case manual inspection of the data validation reports can identify well-offset background binaries—see Section 5 of Bryson et. al. 2013 for details.

In flux-weighted centroid analysis, when more than one source is present within a pixel aperture, either fully or partially, then the combined center of light within the collected pixels will occur between the locations of the sources. When the flux from either the target or one of the nearby contaminants varies in a transit or eclipse, then the combined center of light within the aperture will move across the focal plane. This motion is called a centroid shift. The location of the varying source can often be inferred from the centroid shift. The size and direction of the centroid shift is measured using the flux-weighted (FW) mean, (e.g., the first moment of the pixel data). This mean is computed with every flux measurement (30-minute long cadence), creating a time series of flux-weighted means. The centroid shift is measured by comparing portions of the flux-weighted mean time series that are Out-Of-Transit (OOT) with portions that are In-Transit (IT). The flux-weighted shift of the IT mean from the OOT mean is given as Right Ascension and Declination shifts. The offset of the transiting source object from the OOT flux-weighted mean is computed by taking the product of the FW shift and the factor [1 - 1 / (fractional transit depth)]. The Right Ascension, α (J2000), and Declination, δ (J2000), of the transiting object calculated in this way are reported in the table. The α and δ offsets of the resulting source location from the KIC target star position are also reported. The uncertainties and significance of the FW shifts and offsets are provided but do not reflect systematics caused by crowding. The flux-weighted method can be very accurate when the target star is well isolated and the transit source is located (well) within the flux aperture associated with the target star.

The PRF-fit difference image method uses three images: 1) an average of Out-Of-Transit (OOT) Target Pixel File images from data that were obtained near but not during transit events, 2) an average of In-Transit (IT) image Target Pixel File images that were collected during transit events, and 3) a Difference Image (DIFF) that is the difference between the Out-Of-Transit and In-Transit average images. The difference image provides an image of the transit source (neglecting variability of field stars). The Pixel Response Function (PRF) is a convolution of the Kepler Point Spread Function model with a model of typical spacecraft pointing jitter, providing a system point spread function (Bryson et al. 2010). The PRF is fit separately to the OOT and DIFF images, providing a measured location of the target star (fit to the OOT image) and a measured location of the transit source (fit to the DIFF image). The offset of the transit source location from the target star is given in the table as Right Ascension and Declination offsets (Δα,Δδ) as well as magnitude (sky offset Δθ).

PRF offsets can only be computed on a per-quarter basis. The single quarter (SQ) PRF offsets are combined by a weighted mean.

The target position measured by the PRF fit to the OOT images is vulnerable to crowding. Therefore an alternative PRF offset of the transit source (measured by the PRF fit to the DIFF image) from the KIC position of the target star is provided. Both the flux-weighted and PRF-fit methods will have systematic errors due to crowding when other stars appear in the aperture's pixels, though these error are smaller for the PRF-fit method compared to the flux-weighted method.

The associated error estimates are 1-σ uncertainties.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| koi_fwm_sra | FW Sourceα(OOT) units: hours  | The Right Ascension (J2000) of the location of the transiting object calculated from the flux-weighted centroids. This result does not reflect the systematics due to crowding which can introduce significant errors in the calculated position. | koi_fwm_sra_err | koi_fwm_sra_str |
| koi_fwm_sdec | FW Source δ(OOT)<br>units: degrees  | The Declination (J2000) of the location of the transiting object calculated from the flux-weighted centroids. This result does not reflect the systematics due to crowding which can introduce significant errors in the calculated position. | koi_fwm_sdec_err | koi_fwm_sdec_str |
| koi_fwm_srao | FW Δα(OOT)<br>units: seconds (not arcseconds) | The RA (J2000) flux-weighted centroid shift. This is the RA of the in-transit flux weighted centroid minus the RA of the out-of-transit flux weighted centroid.  | koi_fwm_srao_err | koi_fwm_srao_str |
